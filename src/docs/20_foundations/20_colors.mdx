# Colors

Color is at the core of our product. It helps us make sense of the complexity and guides the user through their experience. Here you will be shown how to harness color when designing and building new features.

## Our approach

Central to the way we tackle color is a single principle. Colors must be defined by their purpose. It's not enough to call a color ```blue```, not even ```PrimaryBlue```, because then the question is 'Primary to what?'. Within this system, colors are instead named by their role. Within these walls, you will find colors named ```text``` or in more specific use cases ```text.warning```.

## Implementation

We use design tokens to implement colors within our UI. These provide a layer of abstraction that enables better maintainability, consistency, and even in the future a DARK MODE.

For example, the token ```text``` used for default text in the UI, would normally appear dark grey/blue but if the user were to switch to dark mode the same token would surface an off-white. In design tokens, the underlying color referenced can change, but the token names stay the same.

## The Colors

Our color system has been divided into two groups Foundations and Roles. 

**Foundations** provide the underlying structure of the UI, design a feature using just these would give you a perfectly functional design but lacking the context and hierarchy that color can bring. This group consists of text, icons, backgrounds, and borders that make up most of a product interface.

**Roles** add visual order and give meaning to the product, these colors will help guide the user through their experience and provide context to the content. In this group, you will find tokens for content-specific roles such as ```text.success``` as well as more branded ones like ```text.accent```. That's where we've put Primary blue in old terms.

### Design token anatomy

To ensure that tokens can be easily understood without additional context, every design token follows the same structure. Illustrated below are the four current levels as well as a fifth planned for future adoption.

![Token anatomy](/images/anatomy.png).

#### Category

The category aligns with the foundation category the token falls into. Right now we only have ```color``` but in subsequent cycles, we will add ```font```, ```space```,```grid``` and ```icon```.

#### Property

The property level highlights what element the token is being applied to. For color, this can be ```text```, ```bg```, ```border```, ```icon``` or ```status```.

#### Attribute

Attribute applies a quality to the property, for color these come in two groups, ```variants``` and ```roles```.

**Variants**

Variants help distinguish between elements with the same property whilst not adding any semantic context. These are best used to create a subtle visual hierarchy between elements in the UI, this is where branded UI elements live with ```.accent```, what we'd call our ```primary``` color in the old lingo.

<table style={{ width: '100%', borderCollapse: 'collapse' }}>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>When no attribute is applied it is the default state for the property.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.subtle</th>
			<td>Less prominent than the default but still clear and legible.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.subtlest</th>
			<td>Our least prominent, use these for non-essential elements that need to fade into the background such as placeholder text.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.inverse</th>
			<td>For when an element appears on an inverted background.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.accent</th>
			<td>The brand accent color is to be used sparingly for the most important element visible to the user.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

**Roles**

These add visual order and give meaning to the product, these colors will help guide the user through their experience and provide context to the content. In this group, you will find tokens for content-specific roles such as ```text.success```.

<table style={{ width: '100%', borderCollapse: 'collapse' }}>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.success</th>
			<td>Shows a positive, successful state.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.warning</th>
			<td>Shows a state that requires the user's attention.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.danger</th>
			<td>Shows an error, blocked status, or permanent change.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>.info</th>
			<td>Shows a primary, stable state or additional details.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

#### Modifiers

These levels take the existing element and modify it to give it an additional quality, currently, the only modifier we use is ```.strong``` which gives extra emphasis to a property.
