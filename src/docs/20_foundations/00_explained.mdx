#Foundations Explained

At the core of our Design System are the foundations, these help keep everyone on the same page, speaking the same language, and working as a team. Our foundation elements of color, typography, spacing, grids, and iconography will form the base of all subsequent UI designs. 

In the future, they will also go further and become the foundation for not just UI designs, but all visual elements of balena. Whether it's the marketing website, a digital product like balenaCloud, or a slide deck presented by Customer Success they should all look and feel like they come from the same company.

You can’t — or arguably shouldn’t — apply the same design systems and guidelines to designing a product as you would to marketing design. They're built on different mediums, with different audiences and business objectives. The roots that support these diverse expressions are the brand foundations.
