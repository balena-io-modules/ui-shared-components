# How to use design tokens in MUI

MUI's theming system is based on Material Design 2 and is a bit outdated. As such, it works differently
than more modern systems.

Our design tokens system, and especially the color system, was designed with modern standards in mind and with a
platform-agnostic approach. So our tokens have to be retrofitted in MUI system.

## Token integration in MUI's theme

Most of the customization should happen in the theme file. There we are importing the design tokens package 
and using the tokens directly.

```ts
// Simplified example of the customization of MuiButton

import { color } from '@balena/design-tokens';

export const theme = createTheme({
	MuiButton: {
		// ...
		variants: [
			{
				props: { variant: 'light', color: 'primary' },
				style: {
					color: color.text.value,
					backgroundColor: color.bg.accent.value,
					outline: `1px solid ${color.border.accent.value}`,
				},
			},
			// ...
		],
	},
});
```

## Token integration in components

The tokens are available using the `token()` method:

* Font family: `token('typography.fontFamily.body')`
* Font weight: `token('typography.fontWeight.strong')`
* Color: `token('color.bg.accent')` (see below)
* Border radius: `token('shape.borderRadius.sm')`

Note that the variables are also available under the `theme.tokens` object. For example, to access `color.bg.accent` you 
can write `theme.tokens.color.bg.accent.value`. The `token` method is shorter though, and there is no need for the 
`theme` object.

ℹ️ The `token()` method translates directly to CSS variables under the `--mui` prefix. It bypasses the theme object and
takes advantage of the runtime capabilities of CSS variables to make it easy to use.


## Recommendations

### Don't use MUI default palette

MUI is based on an old color system from 2014 and Material Design v2, that uses a baseline of `primary`, `secondary`,
and different state colors.

While we can't remove it in order to keep compatibility with most MUI components (components that haven't been 
customized but are usable), we should refrain from using it and stick to using the `token()` method.

### Don't import the design tokens package

Make sure to use the `token()` method instead of importing the tokens from the design tokens package. The
reason for that is once we're ready for a dark theme, MUI will handle the theme switching. If we reference static
variables from the design tokens packages directly, we will break the theme switching capability.

Note: there are some cases where importing the package is unavoidable, for example when using tokens in canvas environments
where CSS variables are not interpreted.
