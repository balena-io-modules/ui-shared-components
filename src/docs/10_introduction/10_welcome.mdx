# Welcome

Welcome to the balena design system, a single source of truth for the UI of balena products, aimed at enhancing collaboration between designers and engineers. 

Here, you will find design foundations such as color and typography, UI components and patterns, as well as elements specific to balenaCloud. 

This system is dynamic and will continue to grow and evolve over time. If you have any feedback or any questions, please
[get in touch](?path=/docs/introduction-get-in-touch--docs).


## What is a design system?

> Design systems bring order and consistency to digital products, They help to protect the brand, elevate the user experience, and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products. They are a source of truth and a system of record for our design decisions. They hold us to high standards, keep teams on the same page, and help to onboard new team members. They document the why, when, where, and how.

[Laying the Foundations](https://designsystemfoundations.com/)

The power of having a design system at balena is that it allows our whole team, working both globally and remotely, to be on the same page when it comes to UI design.

Our engineers can all work from the same set of design tokens, components, and patterns, not only building consistency within the product but also saving time by reusing elements wherever possible.

For product designers, the guidelines that sit beside each element will provide a clear description of when it should be used and how it should work. Becoming familiar with the contents of this system will give you a box full of tools and knowledge of how to use them.
