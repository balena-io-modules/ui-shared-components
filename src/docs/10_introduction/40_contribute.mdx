# Contribute

## Develop locally

### Requirements

- A basic knowledge of git. For an overview on how git works, check out this [guide by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git).
- If you are not familiar with git or the command line, you can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It provides an easy-to-use interface on top of git.
- A code editor. You could use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Run

- Install Node (use the LTS version, not the current one): [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:balena-io-modules/ui-shared-components.git`
- Move into the directory: `cd ui-shared-components`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the Storybook instance: `npm start`
- Storybook should open in your browser. Any change you make in the codebase will automatically reload the page.

### Publishing your changes

- Pull the latest code on the `master` branch
- Create a new branch
- Commit your changes in this branch. Make sure you add the change type by leaving an empty line below your commit message and adding `Change-type: minor` or `Change-type: patch`.
- When you're ready, go to the repository on Github. You will be prompted to create a pull request. Once its done, you can either ask for review or self certify by adding a comment in the discussion containing the text "I self-certify!".

## Add an image

- Add the file to the `public/` repository
- Add an image tag inside your MDX file with its `src` attr pointing to the file path _omitting the `public/` path_.

Example: you add a file called `my_image.png` in a `public/images/docs/` folder. In the MDX file, you can display it this way:

```jsx
<img src="images/docs/my_image.png" width="200" height="150" />
```

Notice that the `public` folder has been omitted in the URL.
